#### Some Building Related Notes ####
 
## Could use a potential block in conjunction with extra extra_tech_building_start = x to block an upgrade being possible when certain buildings are absent.

# For example, fortifications should not be possible unless you have walls built. This should solve the issue of fortifications generating
# when there are no walls.

## Top-Heavy

# Use a top-heavy build system, with better effects as you climb the tree. This means a single high level holding will be considerably more valuable than
# a collection of minor low level holdings.

## Colour-Code Notes

# More information should be planted into the description of buildings and building chains, to give clear information as to what should be built.
# This could help with investment, so people know exactly what to build and why.
