# blackninja suggested a system that uses a single variable to control the amount of gold for building.
# In theory x amount of their yearly income can be added into this bank. If it fails to give ie a base of 10%, then scale down once or twice until failure (skip that year).

# System can also make use of a handful of buildable structures, which serve as investment. These buildings, when built, will eventually improve either the:
# Rural Development (simulating how developed and populated the rural regions in a province or holding are - needs to be decided if this system is handled on a province or barony scale)
# Urban Development (the same as rural, in short)

# Rural and Urban development are controlled by variables. All constructed holdings contribute to the province value.
# Every year or every five years the values are managed. I'm leaning towards count level and higher rulers, so county level rather than barony.

# The higher the development of Rural or Urban, the more developed it will become. Buildings may be constructed automagically through event?
# A seperate Urban/Rural production variable. Controls the amount of resource produced in the province. If urban is considerably higher than rural, it may turn from a resource
# production centre and into an urban production centre. The resource may change as a result. Urban tends to give more gold, but a lot less levy.

# Urban provinces should generally only be the most developed (ie Kings landing sort of scenario), with the largest number of holding slots.
# It should take time. If a province gets sieged down, existing events could lower the development in either category by a point or two.
