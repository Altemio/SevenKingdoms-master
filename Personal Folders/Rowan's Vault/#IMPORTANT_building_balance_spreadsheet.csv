,"As it currently stands, the top-heavy system involves growing bonuses with each upgrade. Initial upgrades offer little, but following upgrades add increasingly more, resulting in a growth curve. In other words all trees are top-heavy. This means it is more beneficial to finish a tree than to leave it partway done – normally it is increasingly less efficient to spend money on a tree, since the bonuses do not scale up with total cost invested.",,,,,,"How Long it Takes to pay off cost in years. ToT C-I calculates roughly how long it would take to pay off ALL costs accumulated to that point against income accumulated to that point. Some stuff may be quite high, due to tax modifiers as they affect all buildings built. re_lumber_1 for example will take 127 years to cover cost-wise alone, but upgrading as far as re_lumber_5 ASAP will result in only 52 years being required to cover ALL tree costs versus 127 for re_lumber_1 alone!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,VARS,,,,,,,,,
