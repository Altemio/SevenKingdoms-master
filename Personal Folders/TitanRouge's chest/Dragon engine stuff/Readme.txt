Information:
#############################
The dragon events are triggered by conditions. NOT by decisions.
This is an early build. Expect possible bugs and blank event screens and an unbalanced experience. 
All scripts were written from scratch. They weren't ported or copied. All script structures were taken from the wiki and the base game.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports let me know.
