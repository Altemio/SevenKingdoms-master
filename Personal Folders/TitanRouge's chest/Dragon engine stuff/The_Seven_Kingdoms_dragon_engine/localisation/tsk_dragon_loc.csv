EVTDESCdragon108;Riders arrived bringing terrible news.../nOur soldiers were killed by the fire of [your_dragon.GetFullName] ridden by [Root.GetFullName]. They had to suffer unimaginable pain before they died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon108;May the Gods be merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon200;You stand before [targetted_dragon_for_taming.GetFirstName] and see the dragon's mighty mouth opening, his teeths tainted with blood and his [targetted_dragon_for_tamin.GetScaleColour] scales shining in the sun as the dragon rises its wings. You approach the beast slowly hoping that it will not devour you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon200;He will obey my whip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAdragon201;As you whip the dragon his roaring grows calm. The beast bows his head and wings and it seems like he accepts you as his master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBdragon201;No matter how hard or how often you you use your whip the dragon seems unyielding. The more you slash upon him the more his rage grows and finally you can see red-orange glow arising from its maw. The flames tace upon you and you feel your skin melt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon201;The world will tremble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBdragon201;AHHHHHHHHH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCdragon203;Everything has been prepared. You approach the fire with the egg in your hands. I …;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon203;… place the egg in the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBdragon203;… turn around and leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon204;Small fractures form on the egg and slowly a small nose feels its way out of the egg. A new dragon enters the world. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon206;A dragon has been seen in your demesne! He eats the stock and burns the fields, someting must be done! Locals have tracked it down and found his lair near a river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon206;I will slay the dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBdragon206;I will tame the dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCdragon206;There is nothing I can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon207;A dragon is a dangerous beast. In order to face this monstrous creature I need to prepare myself properly. I begin with armor, I shall wear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon207;…a shield like a mirror and some light armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBdragon207;...light armor only.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCdragon207;...heavy armor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDdragon207;...nothing. I do not need armor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon208;My preperation is almost finished. The only thing that is missing is a proper weapon. I will slay the dragon with...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBdragon208;...a zweihander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCdragon208;...a short spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDdragon208;...my bare fists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAdragon209;You slowly approach the sleeping [targetted_dragon_for_taming.GetFirstName] as you make your weapon ready to kill the beast. However, your approach is not unnoticed and so [targetted_dragon_for_taming.GetFirstName] awakes and raises his head towards you. The suprise is lost. You can make a final stand or run for your live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBdragon209;You slowly approach the sleeping [targetted_dragon_for_taming.GetFirstName] as you make your weapon ready to kill the beast. However, your approach is not unnoticed and so [targetted_dragon_for_taming.GetFirstName] awakes and raises his head towards you. You hide behind your shield and the dragon curiously looks at  it seeing only himself. He turns his head away from you leaving his eyes unprotected. This is your chance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon209;I will not flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBdragon209;I will thrust my spear in his eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCdragon209;RUN!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA1dragon210;You charge for the dragon but its flames surround you and you can fell them melting through your armor and skin and flesh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA2dragon210;With your full strenght you thrust the spear. As it flies time feels like a timelapse and when the spear was repelled by the dragon's scales you knew you missed and moreover you are as good as dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCdragon212;[Root.GetFullName] has finally recovered from his wound and is once again ready for battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon212;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon213;Unfortunately [Root.GetFullName]'s wound did not heal, in the contrary, the wound grew every month and as a consequence has grown limited in his actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon213;That's not good...He hopefully recovers sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon214;[Root.GetFullName] has finally recovered from his inuries and is once again ready for battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon214;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon301;As the battle begins, [rider_a.GetFullName] ascends to the sky on his dragon [dragon_a.GetFullName] and sets fire to your army. If you do not intervene, the battle is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon302;The foolish [rider_d.GetFullName] has sat down on his dragon [dragon_d.GetFullName] and flies towards you to prevent your attack on his army. Engaging this fight puts you in great danger but a victory in the air means a victory on the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon303;The [rider_d.GetFullName]'s dragon [dragon_d.GetFullName] sets our army on fire. As a dragon rider you can follow your commander in the air and engage the dragon duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon304;Your commander [From.GetFullName] joins you in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon307;As the dragons clash together streams of fire fill the sky. On the ground the armies of both sides fight for victory, but the the real victory is to be won in the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAdragon307;The dragons bleed from wounds and their scales turned black from the fire but it is not over ever yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdragon307;For victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdragon308;The battle goes on and you look out for the enemy rider. As soon as he gets into your sight you make once more ready for attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAdragon308;As you maneuver [your_dragon.GetFullName] through the flames you encounter [encounter.GetFullName]. Though your dragon fights as food as he can your foe's strenght is slightly superior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBdragon308;As you maneuver [your_dragon.GetFullName] through the flames you encounter [encounter.GetFullName]. Though your dragon fights as food as he can your foe's strenght is much stronger. Though [your_dragon.GetFullName] is severly injured he manages to escape. You are safe but your fellow riders do now have to deal with the enemy alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCdragon308;That was close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDdragon308;Ahhhhhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
