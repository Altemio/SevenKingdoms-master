EVTDESCthe_doom1;One of the fourty dragon lords from Valyria has arrived. His daughter claims that there is to be a great doom which will destroy all of Valyria. He sold all his estates in the Freehold and now demands the island and castle of Dragonstone as well as dominance over the islands of  Blackwater Bay.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEthe_doom.2;The Doom of Valyria;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCthe_doom2;Most dragon lords did not believe the Targaryens nor did others but at the very end they felt the disastrious truth. When doom fell on Valyria even dragons were burned by the fire of the vulcanos. Valyria's doom left a power vacuum in Essos. The very few remaining High Valyrians now face the rebellious power of the Free Cities and without the control of the Freehold the rest of Valyria's empire collapses. To the east Volantis claims Valyria's legacy and to the west the successor states Tyrosh, Lys and Myr start squabbeling for dominance over the former Valyrian teretories which will later known as „the Disputed Lands“.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAthe_doom3;There will be blood.;;;;;;;;;;
