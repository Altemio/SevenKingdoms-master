EVTDESCthe_doom1;One of the fourty dragon lords from Valyria has arrived. His daughter claims that there is to be a great doom which will destroy all of Valyria. He sold all his estates in the Freehold and now demands the island and castle of Dragonstone as well as dominance over the islands of  Blackwater Bay.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEthe_doom.2;The Doom of Valyria;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCthe_doom2;Most dragon lords did not believe the Targaryens nor did others but at the very end they felt the disastrious truth. When doom fell on Valyria even dragons were burned by the fire of the vulcanos. Valyria's doom left a power vacuum in Essos. The very few remaining High Valyrians now face the rebellious power of the Free Cities and without the control of the Freehold the rest of Valyria's empire collapses. To the east Volantis claims Valyria's legacy and to the west the successor states Tyrosh, Lys and Myr start squabbeling for dominance over the former Valyrian teretories which will later known as ''the Disputed Lands“. The last dragon riders and dragon lords now try to take over control over the Free Cities claiming that they still are part of the Freehold. Will a new Valyria arrise from the ashes or will its might be forgotten like the old Empire of Ghis? However, the Doom has ended the Valyrian predominance in Essos and so the power is to be taken. The Valyrian age is over but a new one begins, an Age of Blood.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAthe_doom3;There will be blood.;;;;;;;;;;
