#### SOME EXPORTED CASUS BELLI TRIGGERS ####

# reminder: the CB emf_restore_hre is for AI attackers only (though players can be their target); it's the
# emf_restore_hre_player CB which allows players an equivalent type of mechanic -- with, of course, the exception that it is
# much simpler and considerably more balanced for player usage, while the AI CB can be used very liberally and additionally
# has a lot of special-purpose logic to optimize macro outcomes for HRE unification.
#
# the reason I've exported the AI CB's can_use and can_use_title logic to these scripted triggers is in order to block the AI
# from using the standard claim or claim_all CBs on titles which could be conquered via their special CB. this forces the AI
# to press any claims it may have on traditional karling kingdoms during the HRE restoration period via emf_restore_hre and
# prevents, e.g., Charles the Bald of West Francia from pressing all his claims immediately and creating the french HRE in
# some ridiculously short period of time since 867 when we'd like HRE unification to tend to happen more around the
# historical era in which it did.
