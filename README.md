Welcome to the Seven Kingdoms Github!

If you are a player, you should download our latest (stable) release here [link], as this version will be under constant development. Otherwise, if you are interested in testing or helping in any shape or form, this is the place to start! Please note that many issues you will run into may be due to ongoing development.

If you have run into any problems, feel free to make an issue.

NOTE:
ZeroFighterR, using Excel, ran into an issue where the (C) symbol would be autocorrected into the copyright symbol Â©. This is bad, because it won't be recognised and will throw up errors when we compile the map. A quick fix can be found here: http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2008/nov/stopexcelfromdisplayingthecopyrightsymbolwhenyouwantc.html

OpenOffice Calc does the same, but you can navigate to Tools -> AutoCorrectOptions (at the bottom) and delete the (C) to copyright symbol.
