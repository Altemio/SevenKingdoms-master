# FACTIONS
~ Some things to note:
~~ Loyalist faction is for non-dissidents. Vassals will join it if they like you, or if they like the leader of the faction a lot (friends).
~~ If they are not in it, then they are either neutral or dissidents. If you are not in the faction, chances are you hate your liege or wish to stay out of such things.
~~ If other factions are being founded, like the council power faction, it is because your vassals do not like you. As it stands, people can join said factions and win because our Kings have fairly poor demense setup ATM. More development will help improve the situation.

- Have factions take traits into account far better.
- If they have high opinion of you, make them very unlikely to join non-loyalist factions by adding an extra check to the other factions. Twenty or Thirty opinion should be a good base for reduction.
- Make sure the new traits are considered for the loyalty faction.
