Build Status: Functional
State: Not fit for release. Playable, for testing and development purposes.
TODO: Check TODO file, nothing removed yet. Plenty added.

+ Added folders with dummy files; trade_routes, province_setup
+ Added geographical_region.txt dummy file, with placeholder regions. Without it, game will crash after a few days pass; events searching for the regions will cause the crash.
= Should be noted that the title finder will likely cause a crash as a result, due to no provinces being assigned to these regions.
+ Religions.txt added, with placeholder religions. They will need finetuning later, but at least we have them for now.
