        - Castles and temples produce high quality levies, whilst cities regain levy faster but produce worse men morale-wise and number wise.

        - Levy reinforcement reduced in castles, making levy reinforcement buildings more important.

        - Temples provide a small number of knights.

    ~ Mountain and Hills terrain distributed to a number of areas where it would make sense.
        - Hill Clansmen region in the North has been downgraded from Mountains terrain to Hills.
        ~ Mountains of the Moon, Bloody Gate and the Mountain Clans region are among them.
    ~ Night's Watch is no longer de jure North.

    ~ The 'Pope' (High Septon) is no longer landed as a baron in oldtown, but landless.

        - Slothful now grants a small learning boost, since lazy characters may be more inclined to read.
        - Sociopath now conflicts with content, humble, shy and trusting to better reflect more common traits associated with it.

27517-S-1.3A

~ North Empire tier colour adjusted to be lighter and more white, but with a blue tint.
~ A number of new nicknames, many of them specific to certain houses.
~ An array of nerfs, reducing the effective strength of many characters.
~ Halved the levy size of the stepstone pirates and reduced both their tech and the frequency of higher level shipyards.

23517-S-1.2A
= Quite a lot, but too much to put into the changelog. Changes are very extensive.
- Stripped music from the mod. Back to vanilla music until we find music we can use without possibly infringing on copyrights. Music included was uncertain, so removing so to be safe than sorry.
~ Every single Vanilla event and Decision has been edited heavily. Many events have been excluded from the mod, to avoid issues relating to them.
~ Fixed starting buildings for a number of holdings, including but not limited to Oldstones, Oldtown, Arbor, Highgarden, Casterly Rock and Storm's End.
~ Modified ambition events and stripped out all buddhist related events and a (vanilla issue) duplicated paragon objective.
~ Modified factions, removing references to muslim and catholic faiths and pagan related restrictions.
~ Modified positions of every single port and army location, as well as many city locations. A good few hundred provinces touched, so some may have been overlooked.
~ Modified plots, removing references to vanilla religions.
~ Modified focuses, removing references to vanilla religions.
~ Buffed the base value of cities, castles and temples for a number of reasons. Should also help make raiding more worthwhile, as there will be more to raid.
~ Extensive number of custom scripted triggers, used to enhance factions
    - Dornish are now less likely to join factions against their liege so long as their liege is Dornish.
    - Marcher cultures are now less likely to join factions against their liege so long as their liege is of the same group.
    - Old Gods followers are more loyal to their own people.
    - Drowned, Valyrian, Seven and Eastern Pagans are far less loyal when under a foreign religion.
    - Valyrians (culture) are just more ambitious.
    - Council members are more loyal, even with no empowered council. However, they are also more dangerous if they do not like you (and are not empowered).
    - Eastern Religion group and cultures are generally less likely to form factions.
~ Dukes may now form or join the loyalist faction.
~ Moved reachman, manderish and shield islander into first man group.
~ Factions have been overhauled with a wide variety of conditions and scripted effects.
    - Vassals who like you should be overall less likely to join factions against you.
    - Distance, Culture and Religion have a big impact on joining loyalist or independence factions.
    - Some groups are just more likely to split off, whilst others are more tolerant. The iron born, for example, will be far less tolerant of weaker rulers.
    - Your heir, so long as they like you and share the same culture and religion, will be very loyal.
    - Don't trust sociopaths - they don't care if you are a good person or not.
    - Factions will not form against Valyria before the year 7000, due to the power behind the Valyrian Empire. However, the opinion bonus for the Valyrian Viceroy has been nerfed, so expect intrigue and assassination.
~ Many traits have been modified. Mod specific traits that were missing effects have been given actual effects.
~ A number of nicknames have been modified or fixed.
~ Many more characters have been giving fighting/dueling traits, which in turn have been named into "[Rank] Warrior" rather than "[Rank] Duelist" to better reflect their current role.
~ Localisation has been tweaked by SweetThose, so we are no longer using the silly generated adjectives, but some much more sensical hand-made ones by him. Thanks!
~ A number of defines tweaks have been integrated at the suggestiong of SweetThose, including but not limited to reduced loss of levy on disband, making it overall less punishing.
~ Wildling characters have been expanded upon by tsf4, and a wide array of traits have been added, making the region far more interesting to play in!
~ Many more flags have been added, although many are placeholders.
+ Added shipyard building for Tarth.
+ More family members, and ancestors for houses:
	- Stark
	- Karstark
	- Redwyne
	- Hightower
	- Gardener
	- Darry
	- Bracken
	- Greystark 
	- Reyne
+ Created the Kingdom of the Blackwood Vale, and gave it to house Blackwood.
+ Created the Kingdom of the Reynelands, and gave it to house Reyne.
