From Highest Priority to Lowest

TODO (MAP)

+ Assign unique names to every province and duchy. Add baronies to the provinces of the world.
= Most regions should have 3 barony slots. Small provinces may have no additional slots beyond the capital, or only one slot. Capitals should have 4-5 slots, 'cities of the world's desire' locations should have all possible slots (1+6). Locations, like Braavos, may have 6 possible build slots, but none of the locations may actually be constructed.

+ Create a bookmark that fits into the 7400-8000 range. No end date (set to 9999.1.1).

+ Create basic dynasties with Characters to rule from our first start date.

+ Add Localisation for the Religions and Cultures

+ Give Cultures and Religions Unique Colours

+ Create Titular Titles and unique requirements for them. For example, there should be multiple Kingdoms within the predefined seven Kingdoms, such as the North being split between the primary title and the secondary Kingdoms. If the North exists, these secondary Kingdoms should be impossible to make.

+ Give titles unique flags. Current all titles use randomly selected Vanilla flags.

TODO (OTHER)

+ Integrate a duel system, with regular and unique weapon types.
