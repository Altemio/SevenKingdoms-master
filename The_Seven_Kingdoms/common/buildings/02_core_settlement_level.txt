# Settlements have a number of levels. Levels are improved simply through building, but however require a high standard of development in that province.
# We could rename holdings to: Urban regions, Rural Regions, Tribal Regions and Religious Districts.
# OK. Those are kinda bad, but it gets the point across.

# For example, you will first build the most basic building in a new city holding; a hamlet.
