# Settlements have a number of levels. Levels are improved simply through building, but however require a high standard of development in that province.
# We could rename holdings to: Urban regions, Rural Regions, Tribal Regions and Religious Districts.
# OK. Those are kinda bad, but it gets the point across.

# For example, you will first build the most basic building in a new city holding; a hamlet.

# City Holding Core Settlement Levels
# These upgrades may be difficult or borderline unfeasible to obtain. The very high levels should require a lot of prestige and gold to achieve, as well as a large number of upgrades.
# In other words, many of these levels may be specific to certain holdings.

# Each holding is a seperate city. Do not make secondary city holdings a district, harbour or 'poor man's quarters' or some such thing.
# Districts can be handled through buildings. Fleabottom, for example, can be a sub-building district of King's Landing itself.
# Exclusions would be major holdings within the city, like the Red Keep or Baelors Temple thingy.

# Nothing can be built without the base level one building. It is, in essence, required to use the holding.
# It will cost virtually nothing and takes very little time to build. The AI will build it very quickly.
