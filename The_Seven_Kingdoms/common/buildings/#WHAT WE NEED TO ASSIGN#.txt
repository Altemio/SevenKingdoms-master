## When assigning buildings, there are but a couple of buildings we need to assign or a barony.

## Unique structures and resource structures will use province IDs, cultures, titles or region triggers as a potential for construction. Such buildings can be globally forced using:
### extra_tech_building_start = 0.0
### This may not work, but I know as a matter of fact that | extra_tech_building_start = 10.0 | will mean the building is never given to a holding on game start.

## Assign buildings in the <HOLDINGTYPE>_core_settlement.txt file. Nothing else
## You only need to assign one of the buildings, presumably. So if the settlement is a level 6 settlement, assign the level 6 building.
### Buildings will be assigned based on that starting building.
