# Unique resource structures will take the terrain into account, as well as the defined regions.
# For example, farmlands in the Wynelands can have vineyards built, whilst potato and cabbage fields can be built in the north.
# Northern forests can have trapping built, whilst southern forests can have prestige giving hunting grounds.
