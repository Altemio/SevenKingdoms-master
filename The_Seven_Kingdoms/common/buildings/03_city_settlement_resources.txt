# Resource buildings require one of two things:

# the presence of a certain terrain type AND no present 'resource' modifier.
# OR
# the presence of a certain resource type modifier

# Resources can be found in 00_resource_modifiers.txt in the event_modifiers folder.

# CITIES DO NOT USE REGIONAL RESOURCES, ONLY TERRAIN RELATED RESOURCES SUCH AS FARMING.
