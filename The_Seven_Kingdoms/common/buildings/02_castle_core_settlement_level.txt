# Settlements have a number of levels. Levels are improved simply through building, but however require a high standard of development in that province.
# We could rename holdings to: Urban regions, Rural Regions, Tribal Regions and Religious Districts.
# OK. Those are kinda bad, but it gets the point across.

# To prevent snowballing, settlement core upgrades will require both gold and prestige. Or just prestige.
