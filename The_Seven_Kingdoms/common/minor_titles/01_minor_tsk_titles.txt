# Generic Ser title. May want or need seperate 'Ser' titles for the different Knight types.

# Not sure if Female Knights should have another title or not. Although they, of higher birth, may be called a Lady,
# I don't remember if they were ever referred to as 'Ser' in the books. Leaving so they get it for now, however.
