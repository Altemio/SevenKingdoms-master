"ERA_CHAR_INFO_4;Robar II inherited the crown less than a fortnight before his sixteenth nameday yet proved a fearsome warrior and a cunning and charming leader. He united the houses of the First Men that still held out against the Andals - Redforts, Hunters, Belmores, and Coldwaters - as well smaller clans and houses, bringing them together with marriages, grants of land or gold and, in one case, outshooting Lord Hunter in an archery contest - though legend claims King Robar cheated. Thus Robar was proclaimed High King of the Vale, the Fingers, and the Mountains of the Moon. This title would later be disputed by Ser Artys Arryn, whom would fight Robar for the Vale...;;;;;;;;;x"
"ERA_CHAR_INFO_603;Triston Mudd was the father of the dreaded King Tristifer 'The Hammer of Justice', although Triston is consered to be a good King, however some see him as weak. For his firstborn son and heir is a blubbering fool whom will likely see the destruction of the Kingdom of Rivers and Hills. Only Triston's second born son, Tristifer can lead the Muddish people to victory against the Andal invaders, or die trying.;;;;;;;;;x "
"ERA_CHAR_INFO_1216;Gardener King Mern rules over the Reach, however during his reign he has lost much authority. His most trusted vassals have now become almost completely autonomous. He must bring these self proclaimed 'Marshals' to heal if he truly wants to secure his rule. It will be no easy task, perhaps he can instigate fighting between the Marshals to bring them back into his rule one at a time.;;;;;;;;;x"
"ERA_CHAR_INFO_1800;Storm King Maldon Durrandon has won countless victories in his gallant rule over the Stormlands. During the Andal invasion of the Stormlands, as neither side defeated the other, Maldon took an Andal maiden as his wife. Durran XXIV was born of this union. Howver many of the Storm Lords have refused to convert to this new faith. They have procalimed themslves as Kings and now rebel openly against Storm King Maldon.;;;;;;;;;x"
"ERA_CHAR_INFO_400;Tyrion III Lannister was a King of the Rock from House Lannister of Casterly Rock. As the Andals began moving into the westerlands in larger numbers than in the time of Tybolt the Thunderbolt, Tyrion decided to arrange marriages for the more powerful Andal warchiefs with the daughters of the great houses of the west. Aware of Andal betrayals in the Vale, he also took the sons and daughters of the new Andal lords as wards and fosterlings to serve as pages and cupbearers, as well as hostages, at Casterly Rock. However he has still not converted to the new gods.;;;;;;;;;x"
