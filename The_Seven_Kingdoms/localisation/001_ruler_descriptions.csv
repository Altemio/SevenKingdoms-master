ERA_CHAR_INFO_7803;When Prince Roland, the heir to the Kingdom of the Mountain and Vale invited Lord Waymar to the Gates of the moon, Waymar was skeptical at first. Tensions between the Arryns and Royces had never been this high since the time of Robar Royce and Artys Arryn. Eventually Waymar gave in and travelled to the foot of the Mountain of the Moon. For seven nights they feasted and jousted, on the seventh night however, treachery. Prince Roland had all of the Royces arrested and tried on charges of treason. They were all executed infront of the Bloody Gate. When King Osric heard of this he was outraged, he even went as far to threatten to send the Crown Prince to the wall. However, when Andar Royce raised his banners in rebellion there was nothing the just King could do. He would protect his family and destroy the Royce pretender once and for all. As High as Honor.;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_605;King Tristifer IV Mudd, also known as the Hammer of Justice, was the fourth King of the Rivers and the Hills to bear that name. He raised the castle that became known as Oldstones, the strongest in Westeros at the time of its construction. With the Andal invaders to the south, Tristifer must find allies where he can. His situation is truly desperate, yet the Hammer does not flee. To the west Euron Ironman invades, thinking himself the rightful King of the Riverlands. Tristifer will teach this usurper the true meaning of justice. Tristifer must strike down his enemies ruthlessly if he hopes to lead his people to a tomorrow rid of the Andal scourge.;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1216;Mern III Gardener, called the Madling, was a King of the Reach and head of House Gardener. Before the Andals came to the Reach, he showered gold and honors on a woods witch who boasted she could raise armies of the dead to fight off the invaders. During Mern's many fits of madness his vassals gained much power. His Marhals now rule as semi-autonomous Kings. Perhaps Mern's son Prince Garth can end this conflict once and for all. Garth must be weary however, Andal incursions have been spotted from the east and south. All Reachman have heard of the savagery of the invaders. Yet perhaps a bloodless solution can be found through alliances and marriages.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,

As the Andals began moving into the westerlands in larger numbers than in the time of Tybolt the Thunderbolt, Tyrion decided to arrange marriages for the more powerful Andal warchiefs with the daughters of the great houses of the west. Aware of Andal betrayals in the Vale, he also took the sons and daughters of the new Andal lords as wards and fosterlings to serve as pages and cupbearers, as well as hostages, at Casterly Rock. However, King Tyrion has not converted to the Faith of The Seven personally. Hear me Roar!;;;;;;;;;x",,,,

ERA_CHAR_INFO_203;King Brandon once called a lowly wildling bard a coward. To take revenge of this affront and prove his courage, the bard, named Bael, climbed the Wall and travelled to Winterfell. There, he sang until midnight for the King. Impressed by his skills as a singer, King Brandon asked him what he wanted as a reward, Bael asked only for the most beautiful flower blooming in Winterfell's gardens. King Brandon accepted, and gave Bael the most beautiful blue winter rose in the Winterfell gardens. But the following morning, the single, virgin daughter of the King vanished without a trace, and in her bed was the blue winter rose. Lord Brandon sent the members of the Night's Watch looking for them beyond the Wall, but neither Bael nor the girl were found. Some months later the girl was found in her room, holding at her breast- an infant.;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1217;Garth VIII Gardener was a King of the Reach and head of House Gardener. Along with his son and grandson, he is remembered as one of the Three Sage Kings who dealt with the Andal invasion of the Reach with a policy of accord and assimilation rather then armed resistance.Instead of fighting off the Andals, Garth IX brought a septon to his court and made him part of his councils. The first sept at Highgarden was built during Garth's reign, although he continued to worship the old gods. He took Andals into his service as household knights and retainers, and bequeathed lands and wives and lordships for the more powerful of the Andal kings and other Andal adventurers descending on the Reach in exchange for pledges of fealty.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
