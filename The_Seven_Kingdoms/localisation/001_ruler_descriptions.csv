ERA_CHAR_INFO_7822;When Lord Waymar II Royce was summoned to the Gates of The Moon he had been expecting a parley. Tensions between the Arryns and Royces had only been this high during the reign of King Robar II. During a lavish feast in the great castle all of the members of the Royce household were arrested, tried, and promptly executed. Few survived. The new Lord of Runestone- Andar,  made his way back to his seat in Runestone. Upon his arrival all the men, women, and children of the castle were demanding Arryn blood. And so he was coronated the following day. Andar, King of Rune and Mountain, and protector of the Bronzemen.;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_603;King Triston Mudd, the tenth of his name. Was the father of the dreaded Mudd King Tristifer 'The Hammer of Justice'. With enemies closing in from the south the Muddish people must unite the Riverlands if they truly hope to withstand the Andal onslaught. Tristifer must wield his hammer and smash all those that oppose him. It will not be an easy task, but it will be a righteous one. All should flee before the Hammer.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1216;Mern III Gardener, called the Madling, was a King of the Reach and head of House Gardener. Before the Andals came to the Reach, he showered gold and honors on a woods witch who boasted she could raise armies of the dead to fight off the invaders. During Mern's many fits of madness his vassals gained much power. His Marhals now rule as semi-autonomous Kings. Perhaps Mern's son Prince Garth can end this conflict once and for all. Garth must be weary however, Andal incursions have been spotted from the east and south. All Reachman have heard of the savagery of the invaders. Yet perhaps a bloodless solution can be found through alliances and marriages.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1800;Maldon IV Durrandon was a Storm King of House Durrandon. During the Andal invasion of the stormlands, as neither side defeated the other, Maldon took an Andal maiden as his wife. Durran XXIV was born of this union. However, many of the Lords of the Stormlands disaprove of this match casuing many to proclaim themselves Kings. Maldon must take action or his Storm Kingdom may well collapse.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_400;Tyrion III Lannister was a King of the Rock from House Lannister of Casterly Rock. As the Andals began moving into the westerlands in larger numbers than in the time of Tybolt the Thunderbolt, Tyrion decided to arrange marriages for the more powerful Andal warchiefs with the daughters of the great houses of the west. Aware of Andal betrayals in the Vale, he also took the sons and daughters of the new Andal lords as wards and fosterlings to serve as pages and cupbearers, as well as hostages, at Casterly Rock. However, King Tyrion has not converted to the Faith of The Seven personally.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,

ERA_CHAR_INFO_200;King Theon defended the north during the Andal invasion. Aided by House Bolton, Theon defeated the Andal warlord Argos Sevenstar in the Battle of the Weeping Water. The King of Winter then sailed across the narrow sea to the coast of Andalos with Argos's body displayed on the prow of his ship like a figurehead. Theon burned a score of Andal villages, killing hundreds and capturing three tower houses and a fortified sept. The king displayed the spiked heads of his victims along his coastline to deter future invaders. Theon later conquered the Three Sisters in the Bite and landed an army on the Fingers, possibly part of the War Across the Water. He also defeated rebels from the Rills and aided the Night's Watch in imposing a generational defeat on wildlings beyond the Wall.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,
