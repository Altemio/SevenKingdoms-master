ERA_CHAR_INFO_4;Robar II inherited the crown less than a fortnight before his sixteenth nameday yet proved a fearsome warrior and a cunning and charming leader. He united the houses of the First Men that still held out against the Andals - Redforts, Hunters, Belmores, and Coldwaters - as well smaller clans and houses, bringing them together with marriages, grants of land or gold and, in one case, outshooting Lord Hunter in an archery contest - though legend claims King Robar cheated. Thus Robar was proclaimed High King of the Vale, the Fingers, and the Mountains of the Moon. This title would later be disputed by Ser Artys Arryn, whom would fight Robar for the Vale...;;;;;;;;;x
"ERA_CHAR_INFO_603;Triston Mudd is the Muddish King of Rivers and Hills, his reign has seen the weakening of the Riverlands as Andal invaders close in from the south. Only a true leader can lead the Riverlands away from the ruin which it now faces. Perhaps a 'Hammer of Justice' can destroy these invaders.;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1216;Gardener King Mern rules over the Reach, however during his reign he has lost much authority. His most trusted vassals have now become almost completely autonomous. He must bring these self proclaimed 'Marshals' to heal if he truly wants to secure his rule. It will be no easy task," perhaps he can instigate fighting between the Marshals to bring them back into his rule one at a time.;;;;;;;;;x""",,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1800;Storm King Maldon Durrandon has won countless victories in his gallant rule over the Stormlands. During the Andal invasion of the Stormlands, as neither side defeated the other, Maldon took an Andal maiden as his wife. Durran XXIV was born of this union. Howver many of the Storm Lords have refused to convert to this new faith. They have procalimed themslves Kings and now rebel openly against Storm King Maldon.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_400;Tyrion III Lannister was a King of the Rock from House Lannister of Casterly Rock. As the Andals began moving into the westerlands in larger numbers than in the time of Tybolt the Thunderbolt, Tyrion decided to arrange marriages for the more powerful Andal warchiefs with the daughters of the great houses of the west. Aware of Andal betrayals in the Vale, he also took the sons and daughters of the new Andal lords as wards and fosterlings to serve as pages and cupbearers, as well as hostages," at Casterly Rock. However he has still not converted to the new gods.;;;;;;;;;x""",,,,,,

ERA_CHAR_INFO_200;King Theon defended the north during the Andal invasion. Aided by House Bolton, Theon defeated the Andal warlord Argos Sevenstar in the Battle of the Weeping Water. The King of Winter then sailed across the narrow sea to the coast of Andalos with Argos's body displayed on the prow of his ship like a figurehead. Theon burned a score of Andal villages, killing hundreds and capturing three tower houses and a fortified sept. The king displayed the spiked heads of his victims along his coastline to deter future invaders. He earned his nickname, the Hungry Wolf, from the constant state of war the north was in during his reign and his own gaunt appearance.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
