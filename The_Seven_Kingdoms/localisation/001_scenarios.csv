AOP_START_NAME;The Age of Petty Kings;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
AOP_START_DESC;With the aggressive expansion of the domineering Valyrian Empire, it was inevitable that one day the Andal Kingdom would fall to fire and brimstone. Indeed even the fair republic of Lorath would fall with it, and so the last of the Andals would flee west to a new land inhabited by the native first men.\n\nHowever, it would begin a new age of bloodshed, for the Andals would not seek integration with the natives, but would strive to carve out Kingdoms of their own, built upon the bones of the first men and their old gods.\n\nThis is the age of Petty Kings.;;;;;;;;;x
