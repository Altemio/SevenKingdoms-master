TAI_START_NAME;The Andal Invasion;;;;;;;;;x
TAI_START_DESC;With the aggressive expansion of the domineering Valyrian Empire, it was inevitable that one day the Andal Kingdom would fall to fire and brimstone. Indeed even the fair republic of Lorath would fall with it, and so the last of the Andals would flee west to a new land inhabited by the native first men.\n\nHowever, it would begin a new age of bloodshed, for the Andals would not seek integration with the natives, but would strive to carve out Kingdoms of their own, built upon the bones of the first men and their old gods.\n\nThis kind of rapid expansion by an outside force can only lead to further destruction. Will the First Men assimilate into the ranks of the zealous Andals? Or will they push back the invaders and secure a brighter future for their kind? You will decide.;;;;;;;;;x
