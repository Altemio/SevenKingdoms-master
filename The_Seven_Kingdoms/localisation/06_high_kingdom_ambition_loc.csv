obj_become_high_king_dorne_desc;First came the First Men, then the Rhoynar and then the Andals. Dorne was the first place where all three peoples lived peacefully together. Its story is rife, but it's split. Many kings and princes rule independently over their small kingdoms and principalities without much self-will. All united, they would put the other kingdoms in the shadows. Therefore I, [This.GetTitledFirstName], want to become [Root.GetKingQueen] of Dorne.
