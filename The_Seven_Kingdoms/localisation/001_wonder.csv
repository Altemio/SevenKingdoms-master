wonder_winterfell;Winterfell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;
wonder_winterfell_desc;To the descendants of the First Men Winterfell is not just a castle, it is a legend. It was supposedly built by Brandon the Builder over eight thousand years ago with the help of giants and for most of recorded history has been the seat of House Stark. \n\nIt is positioned over hot springs that not only provide a continuous supply of fresh water, but also heats the castle and its environs through even the harshest winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
wonder_storms_end;Storm's End;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_storms_end_desc;One of the strongest castles in the realm, Storm's End was once the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings of House Durrandon extending back many thousands of years.

wonder_eyrie_desc;The Eyrie is an ancient castle and seat of House Arryn, one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility, within the Vale of Arryn. It is situated in the Mountains of the Moon astride the peak known as the Giant's Lance, several thousand feet above the valley below. Although small compared to the seats of other Great Houses in Westeros, the Eyrie is considered impregnable to attack. Its construction was started by Roland Arryn. \n\nDuring winter years, the Arryns seek refuge against the cold at the base of the mountain in the Gates of the Moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

wonder_orkmont;Orkmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
wonder_orkmont_desc;Settled by an alliance of Andal warlords that deposed a driftwood king and dispossessed House Greyiron of their birth home, the Hoares of the black blood rose to prominence by allegedly winning the finger dance against Rognar II, seizing Orkmont Castle as their prize and losing only two fingers in the process. This granted them a bare brute of a fortress, situated above a bowl-shaped valley on the hillside, the lower portion flooded as a salt marsh during high tide. The island's landscape as a whole is barren, having been stripped of its forests long ago, and the Hoares rely on a blend of ore extraction, astute trade, savage raids, and permanent conquest against richer domains. Their sigil represents these varied historical holdings, all bound by iron chains.;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

wonder_eastwatch;Eastwatch-By-The-Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
wonder_eastwatch_desc;Eastwatch-by-the-Sea is the easternmost castle along the Wall, located on a grey, windswept shore by the Bay of Seals. The Night's Watch keeps several galleys at Eastwatch, including larger vessels capable of crossing the narrow sea and lean fighting vessels. The galleys patrol the Bay of Seals in part to catch smugglers who trade weapons to the wildlings.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
wonder_castle_black;Castle Black;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
wonder_castle_black_desc;Castle Black is the main stronghold of the Night's Watch and the seat of their Lord Commander. The castle is situated along the Wall between Queensgate to the west and Oakenshield to the east, near the center of the Wall. Castle Black is not a true castle, as it has no walls to defend it to the west, east, or south. Only the Wall stands to the north. It consists of several stone towers and timber keeps. Beneath the keeps and towers, there is a series of subterranean passages called wormwalks which connect all of the buildings.\n\n This unique castle can only be built once its requirements are met. Castle Black was a large project that took hundreds of years to build, and is not available at game start.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
wonder_nightfort;Nightfort;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;
wonder_nightfort_desc;The Nightfort is the largest and oldest castle of the Night's Watch along the Wall, and the only one whose steps up the side of the Wall were carved into the ice. It sits between Icemark to the west and Deep Lake to the east. The castle has been rebuilt hundreds of times.\n\n The Nightfort does not offer the watch as much space to hold men, but gives a much higher fort level than other castles of the Watch. This does come at a higher price though, since the maintenance to keep the castle in good shape is more taxing.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;

wonder_dragonstone_desc;Dragonstone is a castle located on the island of the same name at the entrance to Blackwater Bay. Located below the Dragonmont and shaped from stone to look like dragons. The castle has a dark reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
