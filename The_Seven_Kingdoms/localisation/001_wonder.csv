wonder_orkmont;Orkmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
wonder_orkmont_desc;Settled by an alliance of Andal warlords that deposed a driftwood king and dispossessed House Greyiron of their birth home, the Hoares of the black blood rose to prominence by allegedly winning the finger dance against Rognar II, seizing Orkmont Castle as their prize and losing only two fingers in the process. This granted them a bare brute of a fortress, situated above a bowl-shaped valley on the hillside, the lower portion flooded as a salt marsh during high tide. The island's landscape as a whole is barren, having been stripped of its forests long ago, and the Hoares rely on a blend of ore extraction, astute trade, savage raids, and permanent conquest against richer domains. Their sigil represents these varied historical holdings, all bound by iron chains.;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
