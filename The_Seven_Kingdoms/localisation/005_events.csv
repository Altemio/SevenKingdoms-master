EVTTITLE_AOPK.1;The Andal Invasion;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.1;In the Riverlands the horns sound as eleven Kings lead their hosts to war. In the North the noble house Stark continues to expand their borders and influence. In the West, the dominance of the Rock is now challenged by the emergence of new kingdoms in the Golden Hills. To the South, the Marshals and High King of the Reach continue their policy of internal squabbling whilst being raided by Andals and Dornish alike. In the Vale a young bronzeman raises his banners against the young fool of a falcon. One thing is for certain however, the final battle between the now two peoples of Westeros draws ever nearer...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.2;For thousands of years the walls and swords of the southern lordlings have kept the tide of our people at bay. Yet their time comes to an end soon. We will scale their wall of ice, we will sack their houses of stone, we will take their women as our own. This we shall do in the coming years. We are the Free Folk, the oldest and strongest of the peoples of this accursed continent.;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_AOPK.3;With the death of Iron King Harras, a new King worthy of the seastone chair was to be elected. The Lord-Reavers and Lesser-Lords of the Kingdom of Salt and Rock met upon the plains of Orkmont to decide this royal question. Yet, none of the candidates could gain enough votes. Among them were Harrag Hoare, Victarion Harlaw, Dunstan Drumm, aand Gormond Goodbrother. All were equally capable of leading the Ironborn to many great victories, and so Harrag propsed that they should all rule as Kings, and their allies should become their vassals, and they would engage in warfare until the Drowned God chose the rightful successor of his domain, and so it was decided.... What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.4;Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.5;The domination of the Valyrian Freehold in western Essos is ensured. The Viceroy dictates his servants from the Silver Palace of Lys, one of the grandest cities in the known world. The Freehold will never fall in our lifetimes that is for certain. Slaves from all over the world mine in the endless chasms of Valyria. Its influence can be felt as far as Blackwater Bay and beyond. All is done under the eyes and shadow of the dragon. Thousands of Valyrians flood into the western territories to begin its colonization. The wizards from the fourteen flames tell of a Golden Age that is set to begin soon for the Valyrians. Kesi undegon ia qeldlie jeda.;;;;;;;;;x
