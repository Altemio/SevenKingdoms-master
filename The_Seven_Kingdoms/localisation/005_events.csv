#EVTDESC_TSK_C_DE.1;You find yourself standing amidst your men, the eb and flow of battle pulsating around you. Weapons clash and men scream around you.

EVTDESCB_TSK_C_DE.3;[From.GetFirstName] stumbles and falls upon a blanket of death as they try to flee from you, but in moments it becomes clear that you are soon to be upon them - and so they desperately ready their arms to take you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_TSK_C_DE.3;[From.GetFirstName] catches sight of you, and begins to move towards you, intent on meeting your challenge.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TSK_C_DE.3;So be it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_TSK_C_DE.4;[From.GetSheHe] charged at me. Although blows were exchanged, I realised I had made a mistake when the world started spinning. Broken and bloody, I am sure not to last much longer...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_TSK_C_DE.4;And so [From.GetSheHe] struck that last blow. Your legs gave way beneath you, and you joined the tide of corpses beneath you.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCE_TSK_C_DE.5;[From.GetFirstName] did not stand a chance before me, and with a swift blow my weapon did fell them. It is clear as day that they shall never walk, talk or even laugh again. The worms will rule over them now.;;;;;;;;;x
