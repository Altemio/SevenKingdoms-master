ca_moat_cailin_desc;Moat Cailin is a stronghold of the First Men on the northern edge of the great swamp known as the Neck, in the North. It is one of the North's most important strongholds, though much of it now stands in need of repair. Its importance stems from the fact that it commands the causeway, which is the safe route for armies to travel through the swamps of the Neck.\n\nMoat Cailin is an effective natural choke point which has protected the North from southern invasion for many years. The remaining three towers of the castle command the causeway from all sides and enemies must pass between them. Attackers would have to face constant fire from the other towers should they attempt to attack any one tower, wading through chest deep water and crossing a moat.;;;;;;;;;x
