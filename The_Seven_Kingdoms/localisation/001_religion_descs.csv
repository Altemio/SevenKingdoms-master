the_seven_DESC;The Faith of the Seven, or the New Gods, is the primary religion of the Andals. Unlike the Old Gods, the followers of the Seven believe in one god with seven aspects, with each aspect represents one part of life or existence. These aspects are The Father, who represents justice, The Mother, who represents peace, The Maiden, who represents purity, The Crone, who represents Wisdom, The Warrior, who represents Strength, The Smith, who represents creation, and The Stranger, who represents death. The faith is a much more rigidly organized and practiced religion, with the central holy text being The Seven-Pointed Star. Regions are ruled by septs, who then answer to the high septon, the leader of the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_seven_gods_DESC;The Seven Gods is a heresy of the main Seven faith, which instead interprets the Seven to instead be seven different gods, instead of seven different aspects. This makes this practice more in line with the Old Gods, and was likely influenced by them. While the heresy would not gain traction or noble followers, the misconception of there being seven gods instead of the seven aspects would remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_mother_DESC;The Mother is a heavenly aspect of the Seven, whom represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. Her veneration is quite popular already amongst the Seven, but certain heresies would come to venerate her as the leader of the Seven, instead of the Father. Followers of this heresy were known to be more tolerant of female leaders in general, and thus may have female septons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_stranger_DESC;The Stranger is the heavenly aspect of death in the Faith of the Seven, whom represents death and the unknown. The Silent Sisters are known to serve him, as they are tasked with preparing the dead for funerals. Due to the wildly different representations of the Stranger, it is unknown if those who follow the Stranger worship all of his variations, like the Seven, or if they group his representations into one god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_smith_desc;The Smith is the further worship of one of the tenets of the Faith of the Seven, as its own monotheistic religion. Followers of the Smith believe he will bless them with aid on large projects, and that they will benefit from his power in their daily lives.\n\n This inbalance has caused them to be seen as heretical in the eyes of the Most Devout.;;;;;;;;;;;x
lady_of_the_waves_DESC;The Lady of the Waves is the polytheistic religion of the Sistermen. It was one of four faiths followed by the First Men, but unlike the other three, it did not survive the Andal invasion of Westeros.

The Gods of the faith are nameless and numberless, and the children believed that each weirwood was inhabited by one of the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
