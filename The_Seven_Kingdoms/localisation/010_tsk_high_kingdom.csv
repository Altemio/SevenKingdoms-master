EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM0;For thousands of years [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] were ruled by petty kings. But now all of them are united in one realm, under the banner of house [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]. Still, some of them call themselves kings, even though they swore fealty to me and are my legal subjects.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM0;Let them keep their titles.;;;;;;;;;;
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT0CUSTOM1;King-tier rulers continue calling themselves King or Queen.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM0;Let them keep their rank but I am the king.;;;;;;;;;;
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT0CUSTOM2;All king-tier rulers are named Lord and Lady Marshal.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM0;There is only one king in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT0CUSTOM3;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM1;[From.GetTitledName] has decided that you may continue to name yourself [Root.GetKingQueen] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM1;Good.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM1;At least I keep my vassals...;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM1;I will not forget my claim!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM2;[From.GetDynName] has named [From.GetHerselfHimself] High [From.GetKingQueen] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and now demands the remaining lands within this kingdom. If you do not accept [From.GetDynName]'s demand and accept [From.GetHerHim] as your rightful liege he might take your lands by war or you join him...;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM2;This is none of my concern.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM2;I shall follow him!;;;;;;;;;;
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT2CUSTOM1;You accept [From.GetDynName] as your righful liege.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM2;[From.GetSheHeCap] is no [From.GetKingQueen] of mine!;;;;;;;;;;
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT2CUSTOM2;If another ruler decides to claim the Kingdom himself you will automatically join him.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM2;You claim the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullBaseName] yourself.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM2;I should be their [Root.GetKingQueen]!;;;;;;;;;;
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT2CUSTOM3;Other Kings might join you and support your claim. After the war they will swear fealty and accept you as their liege. You make ready for war.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM3;The riders have returned bringing word from the Petty Kings...;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM3;So will it be then.;;;;;;;;;;
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT3CUSTOM;Accepts you as rightful liege.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM5;To the [Root.GetRootFromCompliment] [Root.GetTitledName], I hereby swear allegiance to House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and accept you as my righful liege and [Root.GetKingQueen] of [high_king.PrimaryTitle.GetName] when the war is won.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM5;Most unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM5;Great!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM9;[From.GetTitledName] has announced in a royal decree that from now on there shall be only one [high_king.GetKingQueen] in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. However, you may keep your rank and call yourself the Marshal of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM9;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM10;[FromFrom.GetBestName] has named [FromFrom.GetHerselfHimself] [FromFrom.GetKingQueen] of [FromFrom.PrimaryTitleGetBaseName] and has declared that shall be only one [FromFrom.GetKingQueen]. The realm's administration is from now on located at your lieges capital rather than splitted up to several Marshals.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM10;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM11;The war is over and [From.GetBestName] has been defeated. The allies of [Root.GetBestName] accept [Root.GetHerHis] claim on the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] which are now united under the banner of house [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]. No one dares to question [Root.GetHerHis] claim. However, some lords still favor [From.GetTitledFirstName] and might rebell against you when the time has come.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM11;Great!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM11;I am not done yet.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM11;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM12;[From.GetTitledName] has claimed the [high_king.PrimaryTitle.GetFullBaseName]. When the war against [high_king.GetDynName] is won you might join him and name him [From.GetKingQueen] instead of [high_king.GetDynName]. ;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM12;[From.GetSheHeCap] shall be my [From.GetKingQueen].;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM12;I will stay independent.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM16;The war is over and [Root.GetBestName] has been defeated and is now imprisoned by the coalition. The forces of [From.GetBestName] proved themselves superior. [old_title.GetFullBaseName] is forfeit and is once again divided into Petty Kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM16;I will rise again!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM16;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM16;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM17;The coalition has been defeated. [Root.GetBestName] shown that [Root.GetSheHe] is truly superior to the other Petty Kings of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName] and now they kneel before [Root.GetHerHim] and swear eternal fealty to their new [Root.GetKingQueen].;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM17;Great!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM17;We will strike back...someday.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM17;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;
CENTRALIZATION1CUSTOM;All Kings and Queens in your realm shall from now on call themselves Lord and Lady Marshal.;;;;;;;;;;
CENTRALIZATION2CUSTOM;There is only one [This.GetKingQueen] in [This.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. None of my vassals shall ever name himself king or queen nor shall he have a king's position in my realm.;;;;;;;;;;
