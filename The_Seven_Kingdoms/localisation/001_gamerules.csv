RULE_RESOURCE_SYSTEM_DESC;The DRS is a unique mechanic used in TSK. Enabled by default, it randomly assigns resources to every single province (although a handful of provinces are manually awarded specific resources). Disabling the system is not recommended, but can be disabled to avoid an initial multiplayer desync. If a desync is experienced, an alternative to disabling the system is simply hosting a game, saving after the initial desync, then rehosting with the save.;;;;;;;;;x
