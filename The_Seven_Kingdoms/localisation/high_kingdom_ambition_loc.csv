obj_become_high_king_north_desc;For hundreds of years the Northmen were divided amongst many kings squabbling with each other.  In the south and in the west the Andals are speading their faith and are abusing our holy trees. This needs to stop. Therefore I, [This.GetTitledFirstName], want to become [Root.GetKingQueen] of all Northmen to save our people from these unbelievers. (You can declare subjugation wars more easily and lose less prestige when declaring war. However any won subjugation war makes other rulers fearing you much more than before. Beware possible coalitions.);;;;;;;;;;;;x
obj_become_high_king_riverlands_desc;The Riverlands are divided between squabbling rulers striving for nothing more than to maintain their own estates or only to expand them minimally. Therefore I, [This.GetTitledFirstName], want to become [Root.GetKingQueen] of the Riverlands. (You can declare subjugation wars more easily and lose less prestige when declaring war.

obj_become_high_king_westerlands_desc;The Westerlands are the home of the Andals and the First Men, for centuries now we live in coexistence and only with a few wars. We are different from all the others in the East, South and North, we are men of the West and their King I intend to become so that I unite all Westermen and lead them to greatness. Therefore I, [This.GetTitledFirstName], want to become [Root.GetKingQueen] of the Westerlands. (You can declare subjugation wars more easily and lose less prestige when declaring war.

obj_become_high_king_dorne_desc;First came the First Men, then the Rhoynar and then the Andals. Dorne was the first place where all three peoples lived peacefully together. Its story is rife, but it's split. Many kings and princes rule independently over their small kingdoms and principalities without much self-will. All united, they would put the other kingdoms in the shadows. Therefore I, [This.GetTitledFirstName], want to become [Root.GetKingQueen] of Dorne.
