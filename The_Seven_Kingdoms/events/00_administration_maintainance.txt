# wrong_duchy_administration
## Wrong Duchy Administration serves to nerf taking of counties outside of duchies you
## personally own by giving them a large debuff to tax income, levy size and bolstering
## revolt risk in said province.

# administration_main.1 -- Main event, assigns modifier
# administration_main.2 -- Cleanup, removes modifier
