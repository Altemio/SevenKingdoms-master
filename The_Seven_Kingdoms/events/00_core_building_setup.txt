# This event chain assigns buildings to every single province on game start.

# This is a character event, and fires for capital holdings only.
# Secondary events can be fired to assign buildings to baronies.

# Terrain structures are also assigned in this event chain.
# Example: Mountains increase fort defence; a mountain dummy structure is assigned to capitals here.
